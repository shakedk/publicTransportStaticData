# publicTransportStaticData
This tool aims to visualize public transportation scheduling information in order to allow users to easily choose between changing stations in a trip combined of more than 2 bus routes.
The data is real data obtained from the Israeli data.gov.il website.
This report and data visualization were prepared as part the course “Information Visualization” that took place in Ben Gurion University during the 2015 summer semester.
